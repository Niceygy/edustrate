                <h3><strong>Why Edustrate?</strong></h3>
                <p>Edustrate's sole purpose is to enhance and support education across the UK. We've incorporated all of the features needed to motivate children, whilst still helping young adults to manage time.</p>
                <p>Our success is primarily due to our extensive range of features which create an exciting learning environment. Here's a run-down of each one:</p>
                <br>
                <h6 class="text-primary"><i class="fas fa-comment"></i> <strong>Messages</strong></h6>
                <p>Communication is vital to education, so we're incorporating a communication server into our platform. Messages runs on Oval Server, developed by our company HD Software. We think incorporating this allows them to work well with pupils in other locations, especially during lockdown, but also giving them a bit of freedom. This makes them feel less restricted and enjoy their work more.</p>
                <br>
                <h6 class="text-secondary"><i class="fas fa-clock"></i><strong> Timetable</strong></h6>
                <p>Our timetable service allows for time management but also communication between teachers and pupils, reducing paper timetable distribution. Also, it speeds up creating lessons by a significant amount: you just click, select a time, assign pupils and a location, and you're done.</p>
                <br>
                <h6 class="text-success"><i class="fab fa-wpforms"></i><strong> Attendance</strong></h6>
                <p>Aimed primarily at teachers, this allows for easier registrations and absence management. With Edustrate, you can now registrate your class from the mobile app or from the web portal, and you can do it in mere seconds.</p>
                <br>
                <h6 class="text-danger"><i class="fas fa-star-half-alt"></i><strong> Badges</strong></h6>
                <p>To give pupils a sense of achievement, you can use our default badges, or create your own. Badges are earned after a specific event, which can be anything from submitting your first homework task to earning 25 credits for one homework piece. You can even set badges to go towards rewards!</p>
                <br>
                <h6 class="text-warning"><i class="fas fa-award"></i><strong> Credits</strong></h6>
                <p>Working seamlessly with Badges, Credits are little points that can be awarded for good work or behaviour straight fomr the web or mobile apps! Your pupils can redeem them for prizes at any time, all you need to do is set the system running and watch the games begin...</p>

            <h3 class="text-info"><strong>Upcoming Updates to Edustrate</strong></h3>
            <h6 class="">We're constantly changing our lineup, and here are a few of the changes that we're implimenting in future to enhance online learning:</h6>
            <br>
            <h6 class="text-info"><i class="fas fa-comments"></i><strong> Feeds</strong></h6>
            <p><strong>Coming in the next version of Edustrate (3.2.0)!</strong> We're unfortunately closing our Group Chat function, to replace it with a more powerful chat manager called Feeds. Also running on Oval Server, Feeds can have four types:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Casual Feeds</strong>: feeds for casual conversation between groups of pupils.</li>
            <li><strong>Project Feeds</strong>: feeds fot groups of pupils working on a project or task together. These need to be set up by a teacher.</li>
            <li><strong>Class Feeds</strong>: as the name suggests, feeds for communication within a class and with a teacher. These need to be set up by a teacher. Also, Virtual Lessons can be set up directly from the Class Feed using the Zoom plugin (coming soon).</li>
                <li><strong>Public (Q&amp;A) Feeds</strong>: feeds for ask questions to the whole school or year group on a particular topic. These can be used to earn Badges or Credits.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h6 class="text-info"><i class="fas fa-video"></i><strong> Virtual Lessons</strong></h6>
            <p><i><strong>Release date unknown</strong></i> We're working on a video lesson platform. It will allow all you need to keep teaching in person even when you're nowhere near. However, while we code this, we're also creating a plugin that opens a Zoom meeting for your class automatically.</p>
